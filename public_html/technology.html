                <p>AT the App Academy we have to use some programs like HTML and CSS </p> <b> <p2>HTML or HyperText Markup Language is the standard markup language used to create web pages.

HTML is written in the form of HTML elements consisting of tags enclosed in angle brackets (like HTML). HTML tags most commonly come in pairs like h1 and h1, although some tags represent empty elements and so are unpaired, for example img. The first tag in a pair is the start tag, and the second tag is the end tag (they are also called opening tags and closing tags).

A web browser can read HTML files and compose them into visible or audible web pages. The browser does not display the HTML tags, but uses them to interpret the content of the page. HTML describes the structure of a website semantically along with cues for presentation, making it a markup language rather than a programming language.

                <p3>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in a markup language. While most often used to style web pages and user interfaces written in HTML and XHTML, the language can be applied to any kind of XML document, including plain XML, SVG and XUL. CSS is a cornerstone specification of the web, and almost all web pages use CSS style sheets to describe their presentation.[citation needed]

CSS is designed primarily to enable the separation of document content from document presentation, including elements such as the layout, colors, and fonts.</p3>
